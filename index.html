                    <p>
                        Vacation in India in itself is a great experience, 
                        and when it is accompanied by some theme, it becomes
                        more rewarding. India is a land of diversity that 
                        exists in its every facet; be it tradition, language,
                        flora, fauna or topography. Bordered by the mighty
                        Himalayas in the north and east, and expansive
                        coastline from west to down south and further to the east;
                         India is a hub of adventure activities.

                    <p>
                        A few experiences in life are so overwhelming that you 
                        feel connected to some unknown energy. Fascinating and 
                        enthralling to our eyes, we have put together a guide 
                        to witness the infinite beauty and the ineffable vastness
                        of the galaxy that we share with the stars. Not many know
                        this, but India has a whole lot of destinations that offer
                        astonishing views of clear skies which are perfect for star
                        gazing.

                    <h1>Hiking</h1>
                    <p>
                        Hiking is a long, vigorous walk, usually on trails or 
                        footpaths in the countryside.Religious pilgrimages
                        have existed much longer but they involve walking long distances
                        for a spiritual purpose associated with specific religions.
                        "Hiking" is the preferred term in Canada and the United States; 
                        the term "walking" is used in these regions for shorter, particularly 
                        urban walks.

                    <h1>Camping</h1>
                    <p>
                        Camping is an outdoor activity involving overnight stays away from 
                        home in a shelter, such as a tent or a recreational vehicle. Typically 
                        participants leave developed areas to spend time outdoors in more natural 
                        ones in pursuit of activities providing them enjoyment. The night (or more) 
                        spent outdoors distinguishes camping from day-tripping, picnicking, and 
                        other similarly short-term recreational activities.

                        Adventure books may have the theme of the hero or main 
                        character going to face the wilderness or Mother Nature.
                        Examples include books such as Hatchet or My Side of the
                        Mountain. These books are less about "questing", such as 
                        in mythology or other adventure novels, but more about 
                        surviving on their own, living off the land, gaining new 
                        experiences, and becoming closer to the natural world.
                        Many adventures are based on the idea of a quest: the 
                        hero goes off in pursuit of a reward, whether it be a 
                        skill, prize, treasure or perhaps the safety of a person.
                        On the way, the hero must overcome various obstacles to 
                        obtain it's reward.

                    <p>
                        From ancient times, travelers and explorers have written
                        about their adventures. Journals which became best-sellers 
                        in their day were written, such as Marco Polo's journal The 
                        Travels of Marco Polo or Mark Twain's Roughing It. Others 
                        were personal journals, only later published, such as the 
                        journals of Lewis and Clark or Captain James Cook's journals.
                        There are also books written by those not directly a part of 
                        the adventure in question, such as The Right Stuff by Tom 
                        Wolfe, or books written by those participating in the 
                        adventure but in a format other than that of a journal, such 
                        as Conquistadors of the Useless by Lionel Terray.
